                    <p class="lead-paragraph">Music tastes evolve, but rarely do we stop to ask how they've changed—or whether yesterday's hits would even chart today. This project started with a simple provocation: Would Faith Hill's "Breathe," a massive hit in 2000, still resonate in 2024's streaming-dominated landscape?</p>
                    
                    <p>To answer that, I analyzed 24 years of Billboard Year-End charts alongside Spotify's audio features, visualizing how tempo, song length, loudness, energy, and danceability have shifted as listening habits moved from radio to playlists. What emerged wasn't just a story about one artist—it was a window into how algorithmic curation, shorter attention spans, and platform economics have fundamentally reshaped what "popular music" sounds like.</p>
                    
                    <p>The project combines data analysis with cultural commentary, designed as an interactive web experience that lets you explore these trends at your own pace. This isn't an academic paper dressed up as a website. It's a designed argument—an invitation to reconsider what we think we know about pop music through the lens of data that reveals patterns we feel but rarely quantify.</p>

    <!-- The Question -->

                <h2>The Question</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="section-content">
                <div class="content-main">
                    <h3>Would Faith Hill's biggest hit still be a hit today?</h3>
                    
                    <p>It's a question that sits at the intersection of nostalgia, technology, and cultural change. When "Breathe" dominated the charts in 2000, radio airplay was king. Songs had room to build. Ballads could breathe (pun intended). But today's music landscape is fundamentally different: streaming platforms favor quick hooks, algorithmic playlists reward energy and danceability, and listeners skip within seconds if a song doesn't grab them.</p>
                    
                    <p>This isn't just about Faith Hill—it's about what happens when distribution technology changes faster than our listening habits can keep up. By comparing the sonic DNA of early 2000s hits against today's chart-toppers, I wanted to understand whether the music itself has changed, or if we've simply trained ourselves to want something different.</p>
                    
                    <p>The question matters because it reveals how invisible platform logics shape culture in ways we rarely examine. Every time Spotify's algorithm decides what song plays next, every time a producer masters a track to grab attention in the first 15 seconds, every time a songwriter cuts a verse to hit that 3-minute sweet spot—these aren't just creative decisions. They're responses to a technological ecosystem that has redefined what "popular" means.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <div class="content-main">
                    <p>I wanted the site to feel like you're following a thread of curiosity, not reading a research paper. The layout unfolds gradually—starting with the central question, then revealing data in digestible layers. Each chart is introduced with context before you see the visual, so you understand <em>why</em> the numbers matter, not just <em>what</em> they show.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Visual Language</h3>
                    <p>Color choices reflect the tension between eras: warm, nostalgic tones for early 2000s data, cooler, more saturated colors for the streaming era. This visual contrast reinforces the narrative of cultural shift without being heavy-handed about it. The palette had to feel contemporary but not cold—data-driven but not clinical.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Narrative Pacing</h3>
                    <p>Pacing matters. Rather than overwhelming visitors with all the data at once, I structured the experience as a scrolling narrative. You encounter one insight at a time—tempo shifts, then song length compression, then loudness normalization—building toward a cumulative understanding of how these changes compound. Each section answers one specific question before moving to the next.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Interaction Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>Interaction is minimal but purposeful. Hovering reveals specific data points, but I avoided overly complex controls. The goal was clarity and narrative flow, not feature bloat. You should be able to skim or deep-dive depending on your interest level. The visualizations are designed to communicate even at a glance, with layered detail available for those who want to dig deeper.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Typography & Hierarchy</h3>
                    <p>Text and visuals needed to work in concert. I used clear typographic hierarchy to guide the eye, with pull quotes and annotations that connect data points to cultural context. The typography had to feel editorial—confident and opinionated—while remaining accessible and readable across devices.</p>

                    <p>The data revealed five major shifts in how popular music sounds:</p>
                    
                    <div class="process-grid">
                        <div class="process-item">

                            <h4>Songs Are Getting Shorter—and Faster</h4>
                            <p>The average hit song in 2000 ran over 4 minutes. By 2023, it's closer to 3:15. Tempo has crept up too, optimizing for playlist energy and gym-friendly beats rather than radio-friendly ballads. This isn't coincidence—it's economics. Streaming platforms pay per-play, incentivizing artists to create more songs that clock in just long enough to count as a stream.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="process-item">
                            <span class="process-number">02</span>
                            <h4>Loudness Normalization Killed the Dynamics</h4>
                            <p>Early 2000s hits had dynamic range—quiet verses, explosive choruses. Today's tracks are brick-walled loud from start to finish, engineered to compete in noisy environments and grab attention instantly. Streaming platforms' loudness normalization theoretically levels the playing field, but producers still master hot to stand out in crowded playlists.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="process-item">
                            <span class="process-number">03</span>
                            <h4>Danceability and Energy Are the New Gatekeepers</h4>
                            <p>Spotify's algorithm favors upbeat, high-energy tracks. Slow burns and emotional crescendos—hallmarks of early 2000s pop—are statistically rarer in today's charts. We've traded catharsis for momentum. The data shows a clear upward trend in both energy and danceability scores, reflecting platforms' preference for music that keeps listeners engaged and active.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="process-item">
                            <span class="process-number">04</span>
                            <h4>Streaming Metrics Favor Skippability</h4>
                            <p>Songs now hook you in the first 15 seconds or risk algorithmic punishment. The long intros and narrative structures of 2000s hits would struggle in an environment where attention is quantified and monetized per-stream. This shows up in the data as compressed song structures and front-loaded hooks.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="process-item">

                            <h4>"Breathe" Wouldn't Breathe Today</h4>
                            <p>Faith Hill's signature hit—mid-tempo, emotionally patient, structurally generous—would likely be labeled "too slow" by today's playlist curators. It's not that the song is worse; it's that the listening context has fundamentally changed. When you plot "Breathe" against 2023's average hit song, it's an outlier on almost every metric that matters to streaming algorithms.</p>

                    <h3>Asking the Right Question</h3>
                    <p>This project taught me that <strong>asking the right question is half the work</strong>. I could have approached this as a dry analysis of audio features over time, but framing it around a specific song—and a specific cultural moment—made the data feel personal. It turned statistics into a story about how we listen, not just what we listen to.</p>
                    
                    <p>The provocation of "Would Faith Hill still be a hit?" gave me a narrative anchor. Every visualization decision flowed from that central question. When I was deciding which metrics to prioritize or how to structure the scrolling experience, I kept coming back to: Does this help answer the question in a way that feels true to both the data and the cultural context?</p>
                    
                    <h3>Data as Translation</h3>
                    <p>I also learned that <strong>data visualization is an act of translation</strong>. Raw numbers don't speak for themselves. My job was to shape the narrative arc—to decide which trends mattered most, how to sequence them, and when to step back and let the visuals do the work. Every design choice, from color to pacing, was about making the data accessible without dumbing it down.</p>
                    
                    <p>There's a tension in data storytelling between showing everything and showing what matters. I had access to dozens of audio features from Spotify, but not all of them advanced the story. Learning to edit—to choose tempo over timbre, energy over key signature—was as important as the technical work of building the visualizations.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Cultural Context is Everything</h3>
                    <p>Most importantly, this project reinforced that <strong>good data storytelling requires cultural context</strong>. Understanding <em>why</em> loudness increased or <em>why</em> songs got shorter means understanding platform economics, listener behavior, and industry incentives. The numbers are just the beginning. The story lives in what they reveal about us.</p>
                    
                    <p>Without that context, the visualizations would be technically accurate but emotionally hollow. The streaming economy, the shift from albums to playlists, the way TikTok has further compressed attention spans—all of this had to be woven into the narrative. The data confirmed patterns we intuitively feel when we listen to the radio or open Spotify, but seeing it visualized made those patterns undeniable.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What's Next</h3>
                    <p>If I revisited this, I'd love to expand it—comparing genres independently to see if hip-hop and country music followed the same trajectory, or layering in sentiment analysis of lyrics to see if <em>what</em> we sing about has changed as much as <em>how</em> we sing it. There's also interesting work to be done around global music trends and how streaming has democratized (or homogenized) popular music across borders.</p>
                    
                    <p>For now, though, I'm proud of building something that feels both analytically rigorous and emotionally resonant. That balance—honoring the data while telling a human story—is what I'm chasing in all my work.</p>
