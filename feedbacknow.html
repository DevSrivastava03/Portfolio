                <p class="reflection-text">This project fundamentally changed how I think about context in design. I learned that great B2B products aren't just designed for end users—they're designed for the moments when someone needs to convince others of their value.</p>
                <p class="reflection-text">Working with Steven and Amisha taught me the importance of designing for the narrative, not just the interface. The dashboard needed to be both a tool and a story. That tension—between flexibility and guidance, between exploration and persuasion—is where the most interesting design problems live.</p>
                <p class="reflection-text">Most importantly, I learned that design directly influences business outcomes. By understanding sales team needs, I could create something that didn't just look better—it performed better where it mattered most.</p>

                <p>It reinforced my belief that great design is as much about storytelling as it is about usability—especially in B2B contexts where the product needs to sell itself before anyone can use it.</p>
