      <h3>Establishing Hierarchy</h3>
      <p>
        The redesign centered on one principle: <strong>lead with what matters during a live demo.</strong>

        the rest as supporting context.

      <p>
        This card is a hierarchy test: <strong>summary first</strong> (Today’s counts), <strong>then details</strong>
        (timeline), with <strong>visual emphasis on urgency</strong> so sales reps can narrate without hunting.

      <h3>Guided Walkthrough Mode</h3>

      <p>
        Rather than creating a rigid presentation mode, I designed the dashboard
        to support a <strong>guided walkthrough</strong> that sales teams could control in real time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alerts anchor the story, summaries establish context, and deeper metrics
        remain available without interrupting the narrative. Sales reps can move
        linearly when needed, or pivot based on client questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        This approach transformed the dashboard from a tool you navigate into a
        <strong>story you tell</strong>.
