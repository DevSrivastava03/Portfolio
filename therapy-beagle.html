                    <p class="lead-paragraph">Designed a mindful AI experience focused on empathy, privacy, and creating space for genuine reflection. This project explores how artificial intelligence can support mental wellness while respecting emotional boundaries and maintaining user agency.</p>
                    
                    <p>Mental health apps have exploded in popularity, yet many perpetuate extractive patterns—optimizing for engagement over wellbeing, collecting sensitive data without clear purpose, and using manipulative design to keep users dependent. Meanwhile, AI chatbots promise 24/7 emotional support but often lack the nuance and boundaries that make therapy genuinely helpful.</p>
                    
                    <p>Therapy Beagle began with a provocation: What if we designed an AI companion that prioritized care over conversation, boundaries over engagement, and user dignity over data collection?</p>

                        <p>Technology should support human flourishing, not exploit vulnerability. Good design for mental health respects boundaries, maintains privacy, and empowers rather than creates dependency.</p>

                    <h3>Understanding the Landscape</h3>
                    <p>I began with comprehensive research into both mental health care and AI systems:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li><strong>Expert interviews:</strong> Spoke with 5 licensed therapists about therapeutic relationships and boundaries</li>
                        <li><strong>User research:</strong> Interviewed 15 individuals using mental health apps about their experiences</li>
                        <li><strong>Competitive analysis:</strong> Audited 12 mental health apps and AI chatbots for patterns and practices</li>
                        <li><strong>Literature review:</strong> Examined academic research on AI ethics, mental health technology, and human-computer interaction</li>
                    </ul>

                            <h4>Boundary Confusion</h4>
                            <p>AI chatbots simulate intimacy without the professional boundaries that protect therapeutic relationships</p>

    <!-- Principles -->
    <section class="case-section">
        <div class="case-section-wrapper">
            <div class="section-header-small">
                <h2>Design Principles</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="section-content">
                <div class="content-main">
                    <p>Based on research findings, I developed five core principles to guide the design:</p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Transparency Over Simulation</h3>
                    <p>Therapy Beagle never pretends to be human or to understand emotions it cannot experience. The interface clearly communicates it's an AI tool designed to support reflection, not a replacement for human connection or professional care.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Privacy as Default</h3>
                    <p>All interactions are processed locally on-device. No conversations are stored on servers, analyzed for patterns, or used to train models. Users can export their own data but it never leaves their control.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. Boundaries, Not Engagement</h3>
                    <p>The system actively discourages overuse. Sessions have natural endpoints. There are no streaks, gamification, or notifications designed to pull users back. The goal is autonomy, not dependency.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4. Reflection Over Prescription</h3>
                    <p>Rather than offering advice or solutions, Therapy Beagle asks thoughtful questions that help users develop their own insights. It functions as a mirror, not a guide.</p>
                    
                    <h3>5. Humility About Limitations</h3>
                    <p>The system knows what it cannot handle. It recognizes crisis language and gently redirects to appropriate professional resources. It acknowledges that some problems require human care.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

                <h2>Design Solution</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="section-content">
                <div class="content-main">
                    <h3>The Interface</h3>
                    <p>The visual design deliberately avoids the slick polish common in consumer apps. Therapy Beagle feels calm, undemanding, and honest:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li><strong>Muted color palette:</strong> Soft neutrals that reduce visual stimulation</li>
                        <li><strong>Generous spacing:</strong> Interface feels unhurried and breathable</li>
                        <li><strong>Clear typography:</strong> Readable without being clinical</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimal decoration:</strong> No unnecessary visual elements competing for attention</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Core Features</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Guided Reflection Sessions</h4>
                    <p>Rather than open-ended chat, users engage in structured 15-20 minute reflection sessions. The AI asks thoughtful questions tailored to the user's stated focus area (anxiety, relationships, work stress, etc.), giving space between prompts for genuine thinking.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Check-In, Not Check-Up</h4>
                    <p>Daily mood tracking is optional and never framed as an obligation. The system asks "How are you feeling?" without judgment if you don't answer. There's no pressure to maintain streaks or demonstrate "progress."</p>
                    
                    <h4>Private Journaling</h4>
                    <p>Users can write freely without AI analysis or response. This space is entirely theirs—no suggestions, no commentary, just blank space for unstructured thought.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Resource Library</h4>
                    <p>Curated articles, exercises, and professional resources. When the AI recognizes topics beyond its scope, it suggests relevant materials or professional help rather than attempting to address them itself.</p>

                    <p>The technical implementation prioritizes privacy at every level:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li><strong>Local processing:</strong> All AI inference runs on-device using TensorFlow Lite</li>
                        <li><strong>No cloud storage:</strong> Conversations stored locally in encrypted format</li>

                    <h3>Safeguards & Crisis Detection</h3>
                    <p>The system includes pattern recognition for concerning language:</p>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>Detects expressions of self-harm or crisis situations</li>

                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Natural Language Processing</h3>

                    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                    <p><strong>Ethics isn't optional:</strong> This project reinforced that ethical considerations must be embedded from the start, not applied as afterthoughts. Every design decision—from color choices to conversation patterns—carries ethical weight when dealing with mental health.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Restraint is strength:</strong> In a field dominated by feature creep and engagement optimization, saying "no" to certain capabilities proved more powerful than adding them. Sometimes the most caring design is one that does less.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Design shapes relationships:</strong> How we design AI interfaces shapes how people relate to technology. Therapy Beagle taught me that transparent, boundaried design can model healthy relationships rather than exploitative ones.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Limitations & Open Questions</h3>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>On-device processing limits model sophistication—is this trade-off worth it?</li>
                        <li>How do we measure "success" for a tool designed to minimize engagement?</li>
                        <li>Can this approach scale while maintaining its core principles?</li>
                        <li>What regulations might be needed to ensure mental health AI stays ethical?</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Future Directions</h3>
                    <p>This project serves as a proof-of-concept for responsible AI design in mental health. Future work could explore:</p>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>Collaboration with mental health professionals for clinical validation</li>
                        <li>Accessibility features for diverse cognitive and physical abilities</li>
                        <li>Integration with professional therapy as a complementary tool</li>
                        <li>Open-sourcing the framework for others building ethical mental health tech</li>
                    </ul>
